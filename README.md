# Blog-Template
A Beautiful Blog Template for blog writers completely easy coded in Html and Css.<br/><br/>

# Debug
A Debug.css file is created to debug the spaces and content of the Blog. You can use the Blog by changing the line
"(link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="debugn.css ")" to "(link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="debug.css")".<br/><br/>

# Reset
The Reset.css file is created to remove the browser default properties. I already included the external reset.css file to the index.html.<br/><br/>

Feel free to clone the repo and modify to write your blog.
